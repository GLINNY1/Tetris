# 🎮 Falling Blocks Game (Tetris-Inspired)

*A simplified falling blocks game developed in Java to demonstrate core programming concepts like OOP, GUI development, and real-time input handling.*

---

## 🧩 Overview

This project is a minimalist clone of the classic **Tetris** game, built using **Java** and a **graphical user interface**. It focuses on grid-based logic, falling block mechanics, and responsive controls to provide a smooth gameplay experience while showcasing object-oriented software design.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ Graphical interface using **Java Swing** (or JavaFX).
- 📐 Standard **10x20 grid** playfield.
- 🎲 Randomly generated tetromino shapes.
- 🎮 Keyboard input support:
  - ⬅️ Move block left
  - ➡️ Move block right
  - 🔽 Speed up block fall
  - 🔼 Rotate block
- ⏱️ Automated falling via a **timed game loop**
- 💥 Line-clearing mechanic and **score tracking**
- ❌ Game over detection when blocks reach the top

## 💡 Java Concepts Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming**  
  (e.g., `Shape`, `Board`, `GamePanel`, `GameManager`)

- **Event-Driven Programming**  
  (keyboard input handling with `KeyListener`)

- **Timer-based Game Loop**  
  (`javax.swing.Timer` or thread-based scheduling)

- **2D Array Management**  
  (grid representation of the playfield and collision detection)

- **GUI Rendering**  
  (`JPanel` and `Graphics` API for drawing shapes and grid)
